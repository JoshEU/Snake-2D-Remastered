# Snake 2D Remastered #

## About: ## 
Have you ever played the original Snake Game and thought to yourself, imagine if this was 2 player? How much fun would that be? And, no, I'm not talking about Slither.io, but my brand new game: Snake 2D Remastered (what an original title for a game, am I right?).

It involves 2 snakes (Red and Blue) battling it out to be crowned "The All Time Snake Champion of The World!". In order to obtain such a peculiar title however, both snakes must race to reach an ultimate score of 30, which involves eating M&M's (bizzare food for a snake I know). On the other hand, it's not as easy as it seems because in order to do so, they must avoid crashing into the devastating arena boundaries which surround them in their very own pre-built, personal and individual confined arenas (that's if Screen Wrapping/Arena Wrapping is NOT enabled inside the Options Menu). Not only this, but both snakes are their own worst enemy as they must avoid crashing into their tail, which increases in length in relation to how much M&M's they have consumed over the course of their lifetime.   

A few of the features included in the game are as follows: A Game Speed Option: ranging from Slow to Fast (1, 2 or 3), ScreenWrapping/Arena Wrapping: Enable Or Disable this as you wish, Various audio SFX such as: Menu Music, Gameplay Music, Snake Eating M&M Audio, Snake Dying Audio and Win/Lose/Tie Audio and many more features and mechanics.  

So what are you waiting for? Go grab a Friend or Family member or even your Worst Enemy and battle it out in Snake 2D Remastered to be crowned "The All Time Snake Champion of The World!"  
Any feedback is greatly appreciated! :D
